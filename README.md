## About the Video Course
One cannot ignore the benefits of a well-designed architecture and graphical user interface for applications. If you're interested in designing and building graphical user interfaces that are functional, appealing, and user-friendly using one of the most powerful languages, Python 3. This course is for you. It is meant for intermediate level programmers who want to enhance their skills by developing GUIs written in Python.

In the initial part of the course, you will learn the important programming concepts of Python; we also teach you how to create applications step-by-step. You will be using popular GUI frameworks (PyQt5 and Tkinter) to build GUI applications. You will create cross-platform applications, that you build once and deploy everywhere.

You will learn how to create GUI forms and widgets and arrange them using layout managers. We will also look into how to connect our GUIs to networks and databases.

By the end of this course, you will have successfully mastered high-end GUI application such as Card Game and Paint App and will be capable of building many more powerful, cross-platform, and scalable applications.
